        it, I know. But it's how I see it. I'm up for chatting with random people most of the time (unless I got a find

      <h2 class="header">The Predator of Human-kind</h2>
      <div class="scroller">
        Ghouls are humanoids who survive by consuming human flesh. Unlike the mythical, undead versions that everyone
        has
        come to know, these ghouls are living, vulnerable to the clutches of hunger and death. They are biologically
        superior to humans, though they have staggering weaknesses. Ghouls' bodies are comprised of many RC cells, cells
        that normally humans possess, but Ghouls do in massive quantities. This abundance of RC cells cause them to be
        faster, stronger, and much more durable. They are effectively resistant to normal weaponry, even go as far as to
        say they are almost completely immune to them. Guns, blades, and other conventional weapons simply do not work
        on
        them, for they cannot cut the RC-filled skin. They have a special limb that is called a Kagune, which is a
        survival and hunting tool that comes out their body when they need to fight. Ghouls have different types of
        kagune, ranging from ranged types, regenerative, to tank-like, and even ones that which have no blaring
        weakness,
        or perhaps a mix breed of any. Ghouls can only be hurt by other ghouls, or by a weapons specifically made to
        deteriorate or break RC cells, such as a Ghoul Investigator's blades known as 'quinque'. A ghoul looks exactly
        like a human until they release their kagune, so they hide amongst the humans, pretending to be like them, and
        quietly taking lives to live on. If they were found out, their lives were over. They would be hunted and killed,
        every last ghoul. Such is the sick cycle of life and death.

        getting upset. However, she treated ghouls rather neutrally, unless known to be a pain. Over time, these
        feelings
        balanced out, and she became a more caring and loving individual in the face of both humans and ghouls alike.
        However, her cruel demeanor can occasionally manifest into some rough-housing time and again. Her love for
        coffee
        triumphs everything else, and she can always be seen holding a cup.

      <h2 class="header">How to Fight Touka (and other Ukaku ghouls)</h2>
      <div class="scroller">
        <p>There are many factors that should be known when you want to take on a fight with this woman, or any ghoul in
          general. The more you know, the better your chances.</p>

        <p><b>Ghoul Durability: </b> A ghoul has a very impressive durability when it comes to taking attacks. Their
          skin
          is much harder to break, and their organs and bones are much harder to destroy (ie. bullets will not
          penetrate.
          Swords and other melee weapons will not injure her). However, this is completely bypassable if using CRC
          weapons
          (counter red cell), or other ghouls When they -are- injured, they have a regeneration effect. The strength of
          said regeneration depends on the type of ghoul they are. Rinkaku ghouls (such as Kaneki) can regenerate very
          quickly, and because of it, they are typically the hardest to kill. However, such is not the case here. Touka
          does have regneration, but unless she stalls in a fight long enough for it to take effect, it won't do very
          much
          for her. If you're fighting her and you lose sight of her or leave her alone, she can regenerate her wounds
          within a few minutes (though her stamina won't recover). If Touka's kagune is destroyed, she can regenerate it
          within a few minutes, but Touka heavily relies on her kagune to fight. Without it, she cannot do very much.
          Ghouls can take a lot of damage as well, able to survive multiple impalements and burns. In the Fight and Fuck
          Grand Colosseum arena, her physical durability when getting hurt by weaponry is heavily nerfed, so not
          everyone
          is required to carry CRC weapons to harm her. However, ghouls can be killed in other ways, such as drowning,
          bleeding out, being crushed, and many other tactics. Ghouls are also almost completely resistant to poison and
          diseases, for their immune system is extremely strong.</p>

        <p><b>Ukaku: </b> Touka is an Ukaku ghoul. An Ukaku ghoul is a type of ghoul that sports high speed and low
          stamina, and excel at ranged attacks. While this kind of kagune is seen in both male and female ghouls, this
          type of kagune is mostly given to females due to their small stature and light weight. An Ukaku sports two
          large
          feather-like wings that are seemingly made of fire. These wings can either be used offensively or defensively.
          They can solidify and turn into hardened crystals, and can bend in any way the user chooses to. It can be
          thrown
          in front as a shield, or wrapped around and twirled as a hybrid of protection and attacking. These wings can
          be
          used to glide (but not fly), and produce crystal-like shards that are then shot at a high speed towards the
          target. Typically, these shards are shot at mass quantities at once, so they can be very difficult to avoid.
          Touka does best at a far range, so it is recommended to always be up close to Touka and attempt to use
          manuevers
          that prevent her from moving, such as grabs or slows. Due to her low stamina, her goal in a battle is to end
          it
          as quickly as possible, and with her speed and ranged abilities, this is very much possible to the unprepared
          opponent. Some Ukaku ghouls also possess the ability to use bioelectric fields, mostly for offensive purposes.
        </p>

        <p>For a better understanding of kagune, think of it as a survival tool for ghouls. They need it to defend
          themselves, as well as to hunt and kill humans, their source of food. They are an extra set of limbs that
          humans
          don't have. They come from a unique body part called the kakuho, which is holes underneath the flesh that
          produce RC cells to make this kagune come to life. The skin covering the kakuhos will break, allowing the
          kagune
          to slip free. Damaging a ghoul's kakuho can prevent them from using their kagune almost entirely. In this
          case,
          Touka has two kakuho's located on her shoulders. If you critically damage them, she'll be robbed of 90% of her
          fighting capabilities, pretty much securing a victory over her. However, targeting a kakuho is rather
          difficult.
          Not only must you get behind them, but their kagune can't be active, as the kagune would block access to them.
        </p>

        <p><b>Kakuja: </b> A kakuja is a twisted manifestation that rarely occurs in ghouls who practice cannibalism (in
          this case, Touka was force fed ghoul flesh as a method of torture). Cannibalism is typically unhealthy for a
          ghoul due to it causing insanity. However, in rare cases, cannibalism can cause a special type of kagune to
          manifest onto a ghoul, a very powerful and hard to use kagune called a 'kakuja'. A kakuja is a very powerful
          kagune that greatly increases the abilities of its user. Mastery of a kakuja is extremely difficult, and often
          leads to the users death (going insane and rampaging until someone kills them). But in this case, mastery of
          her
          kakuja was able to be accomplished due to her long time friend, Kaneki, who also possesses one. Touka's kakuja
          provides an exceptional amount of defense, as well as greatly increasing her strength, speed, regeneration
          factors, and stamina. It can also give her the ability to use bioelectric fields much more potently, up to the
          point where she straight up shoots lightning. Once per fight, activating her kakuja will restore up to a third
          of her health. As a result, she uses her kakuja when she's about to lose. She delves more into melee in this
          form, since it's much easier to do so, but ultimately keep her ranged attacks coming. Be careful when facing
          Touka when she's using this; she's at her most powerful. </p>

            In the very beginning, Touka was as an innocent little ghoul squirt as they came. For the first five years
            of
            her life, her story was filled with the love and care that a small child should always be given. She was
            very
            happy, and a very nice child, even though she occasionally got jealous of her little brother, Ayato, when he
            got attention.

        <div class="scroller">
          <p>
            Touka was in the loving care of her father, Arata Kirishima. The mother was hardly around, leaving most of
            the
            care of the siblings in his hands. Her brother was Ayato Kirishima, also a kind child, though had very
            different opinions about the various things around them. Arata held a terrible secret from his kids; a
            secret
            they would not discover for a very, very long time. A secret that made him pay the price.

            One day, the two siblings found an injured bird and moved to take care of it, nursing it back to health. One
            day it lashed out on Touka when it began to lash out in a frenzy, shooting from the cage and pecking her
            right
            above her eye, leaving a scar. It is the reason why she hides her other eye, is so people would not see the
            old injury. To this day, Touka has an phobia for bird-like creatures.

            locals had come to seek the children they somehow figured out were ghouls. The locals managed to harm Ayato,
            but Touka, using her kagune early (and damaged it in the process), defended her little brother from their
            onslaught and attempted captures. They were ran out of the place they once called home. With no signs of
            Father, they continued to move, unaware of their destination.. or of how long they could keep it up.

            he
            owned, called 'Anteiku'. It was there that the two ghouls would continue to live, and as they slowly grew up
            in new territory, they began to turn cold to the world around them, as the world had taken their happiness
            away despite Yoshimura's attempts to keep them docile and friendly folk.

            Despite Yoshimura's attempts to raise them to be loving people, Touka and Ayato had turned into ruthless
            ghouls who consistently encroached in other ghoul's feeding grounds, causing them to become very hated by
            the
            rest of the ward. They often got into fights with people over the smallest things, though Ayato was mostly
            the
            cause of these actions, with Touka merely following them.

            As the two siblings developed, their caretaker, Yoshimura, was pushing them to become more active in the
            human
            community. School was one such attempt, not only to mingle and understand humans better, but to also move up
            on life and perhaps one day get a job and home of their own through education. Touka was hesitant on the
            thought of school, even when Yoshimura offered to fully pay for her schooling. While Touka eventually caved
            in
            and decided to go, Ayato did not budge at all on the subject, claiming he absolutely loathed humans for what
            they did to Arata, his father.

            After a long while of attending school, Touka comes to enjoy the presence of humans. She makes friends at
            the
            school, especially with a specific young woman. Ayato sees the large change that the old man had pushed onto
            his sister, and absolutely loathed in. In a fit of anger, he lashed out at his sister, stating he could not
            believe she could become so cozy with the humans after what they have done to their family. Afterwards, he
            no
            longer saw a reason to stay at Anteiku. He left, leaving his sister behind and heading to the 24th ward and
            quickly became known as a problem there. Touka was left alone, and she fell into a deep depression for a
            very
            long time.

        <div class="scroller">
          <p>
            Lately, Touka found a young man that goes by Ken Kaneki. He's been visiting the cafe more often, and he was
            starting to become a regular. He was quiet, and always had his nose in his book. He certainly wasn't a
            trouble
            maker, a quality Touka was more than happy to see. One evening after work she came across Kaneki walking
            with
            Rize, a ghoul that is known to be a binge eater; someone who eats humans indiscriminately. It was clear that
            Kaneki was Rize's next meal. Touka gave a scowl and minded her own business, leaving Kaneki to his fate.

        <div class="scroller">
          <p>
            With the mysterious death of Rize, Touka saw a commotion about fighting for the territory Rize once had. One
            of them was a person known as Nishiki, a high school student who was very territorial. The other was Kaneki,
            who was somehow still alive. Touka was able to defeat Nishiki with ease, due to her being much stronger than
            him. He then ran away, leaving Kaneki to the victor. She soon discovered that he was not actually human, but
            some kind of half human, half ghoul hybrid. Kaneki began to speak about being once human, and Touka
            immediately began to berate him, calling him prey and trash, that he would not last long in this new cruel
            world. She began to viciously attack Kaneki with fists and feet in anger when being called a monster, only
            to
            be stopped by Yoshimura. He was taken in by the old man, much to Touka's open disappointment.

            Yoshimura detects trouble brewing once again with Nishiki, and sends Touka to stop the fighting. She takes
            off, eventually arriving at a very interesting scene; Nishiki was defeated by Kaneki. Despite being told to
            eat human meat to stave off starvation, Kaneki refused and eventually gave into the hunger and he made for
            his
            unconscious friend. At this point, Touka had made her way in and decided to do a solid for the man she
            didn't
            like, and got in the way of his feast. Kaneki, now pissed off and filled with a raging hunger, goes for
            Touka.
            Touka flourishes her kagune and easily defeats Kaneki. Kaneki wakes up later at the cafe she works at,
            Anteiku. He was talked to again by Yoshimura and was fed while unconscious, and then offered shelter and
            safety from other ghouls if he worked at Anteiku. Kaneki accepts and starts working there.

            known as Jason, stopped by Asaki's (Himani's father) work and demanded a new torturing tool for his sick
            ideals. They came out of fear something might have happened to their beloved family member, and Touka was
            quick to calm them down. Touka is friends with the Ryouko and is always looking out for her. The two women
            move to talk to Yoshimura in private, leaving Kaneki and Touka to themselves for the time being. Touka could
            not help but wonder what the issue was, but kept it to herself for the time being.

        <div class="scroller">
          <p>
            Due to the activities from Rize and Jason, ghoul hunters (or the 'Doves') have become more active in the
            20th
            ward. As a result, Yoshimura sends Touka to take Kaneki to get his mask made by a friend named Uta. When
            fighting, a ghoul must keep themselves anonymous, for only a face is needed to hunt down a ghoul. The doves
            could get an identity match on the ghoul and use it to find their name, and then where they live, what they
            do, and so on. So when out in the field ready to hunt or kill, it was important to have a mask, and that is
            the purpose of this visit. Touka minds herself as Kaneki and Uta talk about the mask, before eventually
            bringing up Touka's good looks and wondered why Kaneki didn't have a big interest in her. He replied that he
            did, but he 'was also scared of Touka'. Touka caught none of this conversation.

            their second meet, she slowly becomes more and more used to Kaneki's presence, even to the point where she

            Another day passes and a new character, known as Shuu, or the 'Gourmet' comes in to assess the situation at
            Anteiku. He finds Kaneki and immediately becomes interested in him. Though he was not able to indulge long
            with the half-breed. Touka was quick to shoo him away. She was aware that Shuu enjoyed snatching people and
            then feeding them to ghouls in some kind of restaurant, and she immediately would have none of that. After
            Shuu's departure, the woman informed Kaneki not to go near that man, as he was nothing but trouble. However,
            with the lure of Shu being a bookworm, Kaneki ended up ignoring her warning.

            Touka quickly learns of Shuu kidnapping Nishiki's girlfriend to lure Kaneki into a trap. The reason? Shuu
            wanted to eat Kaneki, as he was a half-breed and they were so rare that they were unheard of, and apparently
            quite tasty. Nishiki, still injured with his fight from Kaneki, regrettably teams up with Kaneki and they
            both
            set off to rescue the damsel in distress. However, when the two went into the
            church for the rescue, they were easily defeated by Shuu. It was then that Touka arrived with a sneak attack
            on Shuu. He recovers, and the two would battle it out, with the bluette fighting to save her co-worker.
            After
            a hard-fought battle, Touka came out on top, spitting on his corpse and telling him to eat his own flesh if
            he

            The fight against Shuu took a massive toll on Touka's body, and she required a few days to rest, unable to
            work. When she recovered, she found that the Anteiku staff have gathered in a meeting, and with confusion,
            she
            pushed herself in to find out what was going on. She found out that Ryouko, as well as her husband, were
            both
            slain by the Doves. Ryouko and her husband were peaceful ghouls, unable to hunt and kill humans, and got
            their
            meals from Anteiku. Touka was angry; why take the lives of innocent people? Simply because they were ghouls,
            that was the only reason they were slain. With thoughts of her friend dead, and the kid they left behind now
            an orphan, the woman's heart fills with unbridled rage. Vengeance was on her mind. Yoshimura downtalks
            Touka,
            telling her not to go out to get revenge, as doing so would bring more attention to the 20th ward. Touka
            ignores this warning and runs straight out of Anteiku to get revenge.

            Touka finds a small mask that she used to use when she played with Ayato; a bunny mask. She dons it, as well
            as a getup she threw together, then went out to fight the doves responsible for Ryouko's death. She managed
            to
            kill one of them, but before she could kill the others, the one who struck down Ryouko appeared; Kureo Mado.
            She attacked at him and Mado quickly figured out she was there to avenge Ryouko and began to belittle Touka,
            insulting her to become more angry. Despite her efforts, she could barely even lay a hand on her opponent,
            and
            with an easy strike to Touka, she was forced to flee, that one attack greatly injuring the woman. She went
            back to Anteiku and the staff there scolded her, telling her she would receive no help from her injuries.
            She
            gave a grunt and attended to attempt first aid on herself with no success. Kaneki attempts to help, but
            drives
            him away. He assured Touka to be careful because if she were to die, he would be sad. This greatly confused
            her, catching her off guard. The words sank into her head as she fumbled with the bandages in the first aid
            kit. The fight against Mado officially gave her the nickname, 'The Rabbit'. A name which all ghoul
            investigators come to know.

            Touka, still recovering from her injury, was attempting to set up a trap for Mado to avenge Ryouko. She set
            up
            false information to a location to lure him in, but Mado was one step ahead, taking Ryouko's remains and
            stashing them into said location ahead of time. The scent of her mother lures Himani and she rushes off in
            excitement, causing Touka to panic and attempt to stop her with no success. Upon arriving, Mado was quick to
            ambush Touka and Hinami. Since Touka was unable to bide time to grab her mask and outfit, she was fully
            exposed to the ghoul investigator. This officially became a kill-or-be-killed scenario, for if they escaped,
            they would simply track her to Anteiku, and the shop would suffer, so one of them had to die. The fight
            began,
            and Touka, still injured, was quickly overpowered by Mado's quinque, which was so happened to be made by
            Ryouko's kagune, angering Touka even further. However at this point, Touka was all talk. She was on deaths
            door with several holes in her. When Mado began to deliver the final blow, the little Hinami that was
            sobbing
            the whole time finally acted out in pure rage. Hinami quickly slays Mado with impressive power, but refused
            to
            finish him off. The injured Touka brought herself up and finished off the investigator and Touka takes
            Hinami
            home, surprised that Hinami already had her kagune.

            Kaneki manages to break himself out of the hellish prison that Jason had put up for him, killing Jason in
            the
            process. On his way out, he finds Touka beaten and worn by her brother and quickly intervenes to prevent her
            from being finished off. She is taken to safety and proceeds to beat Ayato half to death, breaking exactly
            half of the bones in the male's body, silencing his screams with the phrase 'Does it hurt? Though Touka went
            through more pain than this.' Kaneki left Ayato alive due to him being the only family Touka had left.
            Afterwards he told Touka that he will be not returning to Anteiku, apologized, and left a fumbling woman
            alone, the gal falling soon into depression once again, having lost yet another friend.

            requiring very high grades across the board. She does not falter and studies hard to meet this goal.

            become
            sad. What was he doing with Aogiri? She briefly saw on the news that a ghoul named 'eyepatch' was battling
            against the doves directly, which concerned her. She attempted to keep this out of her mind and was mostly
            successful. Unless he was brought up again.

            months without any violence, he was doing a good job. However, this did not sit well with Touka. She blurted
            out hateful words to him about being selfish and never putting his friends first, and that she hated him for
            it. He then replied that as long as she was safe, then he was fine with that. This tilted her over the edge,
            and she socked Kaneki right in the face and told him never to come back.

            2 Years after the destruction of Anteiku, Touka sets up a new cafe shop called :re. For these two years,
            life
            has been relatively peaceful. Touka knew Kaneki wasn't dead, even when defeated at the hands of Arima, the
            CCG's strongest ghoul investigator, also known as 'The White Reaper'. One day when working in :re, she comes
            across Kaneki once more, but this time as a different person altogether. He was now known as Haise Sasaki.
            With his memories completely erased, he has no memories of Anteiku or Touka, and she was aware of this. It's
            been 2 years since she's last seen him, and she was forgotten. She looks on at him, saddened by his fate.
            However, it didn't matter. It doesn't matter if he's changed appearance, it doesn't even matter if she's
            forgotten. As long as he comes back home, then it's alright.

            him
            for that death. They take him back to the cafe and nurse him back to health. As far as the doves understood,

            attempt to free a very powerful ghoul that has been locked away, and the crew at :re move to slip in during
            the chaos and try to free her. In the way of Hinami was Arima, the White Reaper. A very powerful foe that
            was
            the her father's killer. Yomo was especially pissed off at this, and charged out to fight him. With the
            sudden

            much stronger. Kaneki tells them to go get Hinami and get out of here. Touka gave a smile and nodded, and
            she
            told Kaneki that she would see him soon, and then left. These words stung Kaneki, hard. Because he was
            fighting the White Reaper, the most powerful CCG member out there. He planned on dying in this fight. See
            him
            soon? Did she even begin to understand those words?

            Kaneki believes that there is a future where ghouls and humans can live together in peace. He made friends
            during his time as Haise, due to him being a Dove back then when his memories were erased. He called upon
            them, as well as the remnants of Aogiri to talk about working together to take down the new leader of the
            CCG,
            who was being very aggressive with ghoul killing, and this was getting in Kaneki's way. Almost everyone
            refused to be a part of Goat, and because of it, Kaneki did not have the forces he was seeking to claim.

            that the CCG didn't know about before and slaughtered thousands of ghouls, innocent and not. The news

            One of the CCG people that did team up with Kaneki was known as Akira Mado. A woman that had mourned Kureo's
            death at the hands of 'The Rabbit'. Since they were allies now, she decided to release the tension. She
            dragged Akira out of bed and informed her that she was the rabbit, and she was the one that killed her
            father.
            Akira loathed Touka for this. "That's one hell of a thing to drag a sick woman out of bed to say to." Touka
            informs her that she only did it because he was after Hinami, though the hatred for Touka was strong, seeing
            Hinami going up to Akira and telling her that she forgave her father for killing Hinami's parents.. it drove
            down the rage just a bit.

            explained to a dumbstruck Kaneki that she always noticed that during his visits while he was Haise that she
            caught his glances towards her. And then informed him that she was surprised that he didn't see her.. taking

            Touka now carried a half-human, half-ghoul baby inside of her. It was known that a ghoul and a human cannot
            breed very well together, that the chance of the baby's survival is less than 10%. On top of this, for the
            baby to get nurishment, she is forced to eat human food; the poison for ghouls. Eating human food is
            disgusting and dangerous for a ghoul, but for the child, it was necessary. With great hesitation, she builds
            up the courage to eat, putting her health at risk for her baby.

            investigators of their own, telling them that the very thought of working with ghouls angered them. That the
            very notion would destroy their pride. In a fit of anger, Touka grabs her mask and throws it into the air,
            shouting "Pride? This is what I think about your stupid pride." All of the ghouls follow suite, exposing
            themselves fully to the CCG. They were committed now. If the CCG still said no, they would all be hunted
            down,
            their identities now known. It was to show the CCG how dedicated they really were to save Kaneki. Eventually
            the CCG agreed, and officially, for the first time in history, ghouls and humans band together to deal with
            a
            bigger threat.

            removing the core; AKA Kaneki. But to serach for a man in such a huge kakuja, it seemed impossible. It was
            until Touka recalled that she gifted her father's ring to Kaneki, and came to the conclusion that he could
            be
            found by using metal detectors. Shuu made a call to his father and had him buy a ton of metal detectors, and
            everyone would begin the search to find Kaneki. As they searched, however, The Dragon's dormant would not

            another

            The canon ends after Kaneki is freed from the Dragon and they end up getting together to create Ichika.
            After
            the Dragon was destroyed and Ichika was conceieved, Kaneki and Touka went their separate ways, with Touka
            wishing to travel the world and get serious about her cafe business. To her, :re was her passion, but it
            wasn't enough. After repairing :re after the incident with Mutuski, she traveled across the world to start a
            business of her own. She would call it, 'Kiri Cafe'.

            Kiri Cafe, or the Kirishima Cafe, is her new brand that she attempts to get across the world, starting with
            the United States of America. After a long, hard-fought battle, she was able to successfully place her cafe
            in
            California, and within a few weeks of working there, her cafe was quickly branded as one of the best cafes
            of
            the state. With her bit of magic made with helping there to get the popularity going, she departed, heading
            next to Iowa, and easily got herself going there, then once more down at Texas. While still working to get
            her
            cafe to the other parts of America, she is content, for the time being, with what she had now. (Image WIP)

            A portal manifests into the business district of Tokyo. The police force investigated and attempted to close
            it, but for some reason, they could not pass through it. Touka saw this portal after news broke out about
            it.
            She moved to check it out for herself, and she ended up making her way directly through it, to this day she
            could not figure out how, but through the portal she goes, slipping into the unknown. (Image WIP)

            name was a little offputting, she grew curious and began to explore. She soon understood that this was a
            realm
            of which multiple universes come together, linking to this area as a middle grounds kind of place. The past,
            the present, the future-- Even the dead, can reunite here. This place offered the ultimate cheat towards

            to test ones limits and move to surpass them. It was here that she met many people, both friendly and not.

            first, Touka decided to make her a passtime to try to open them up a bit. Over the course of months, she was
            successful, and the two would begin dating. Eventually the woman brought Touka to Remnant, a place filled
            with
            giant monsters known as 'grimm' that attack settlements when negative emotions arise. She arrived at Raven's
            camp full of bandits, who seemed to immediately distrust her, but this is where she stayed for the next six
            months. It was around this time that Touka had come to know about the other members of Raven's tribe, and
            grew
            to trust them, and them to her.

            Every once in a while she would return back to Tokyo to manage her cafe and keep bills paid. Raven and Touka
            go out for a walk in the winter near a park where she lived. Ther was no wind, and the snow was just
            perfect,
            coming straight down to create a soft, pillowy cold surface. The two make it to the park and enjoy a nice
            time
            together, before finally deciding to head home, only to notice something: There was a fire, and it was
            coming
            from the direction of her house! Raven flew on ahead to check it out, and saw that her house was indeed on
            fire. The home she knew was set ablaze, and before she could do anything about it, Jason struck. Attacking
            Touka and beating her unconcious, Jason fights Raven. While Raven was fast, she could not seem to land a
            blow
            against the evasive Jason. He sicks a new recruit onto her, a woman with a quinque that had the ability to
            warp time. Whenever Raven attempts to run passed her and save Touka, she would be displaced by the illusion,
            and found herself back against the enemy. It is when that Kaneki joined up with Raven, hearing about the
            news,
            and while the two did not like each other very much, they teamed up to kill the opponent. They were
            eventually
            successful in killing her, and with the illusion dropped, they moved to secure Touka.

            The two find that Jason had established a new base in an abandoned construction site, and so the two
            retreated. Kaneki, a higher up of the CCG, now come to form an army to invade and kill Jason, as they once
            did
            before. After preparations were made, the two, along with the CCG, made their way to the construction site
            and
            was quick to invade it. Kaneki stayed behind to help out with the battle and Raven ran on ahead, only to be
            stopped by a special guest, one bent on getting revenge: <b>Cinder. </b> The woman's arm has been regrown
            back
            to how it was before it was replaced by that grimm hand, and more importantly, one of her eyes had turned
            blood red. Cinder, in able to get revenge, had used Jason to become a one-eyed ghoul. The two battled, and
            through the use of her new quinque given by Touka, she used it to slay Cinder, having the weapon to
            counteract
            ghouls. She moved on, leaving the corpse behind to finally find Touka. She was being.. force fed by Jason.
            Not
            just flesh though, ghoul flesh! There were plenty of bodies around them, and Touka was beaten, bruised, cut
            up, and with a bit of vomit, and definitely a lot of blood over her. In a rage, Raven fights Jason. The
            battle
            was hard fought and long, but eventually Raven was successful. With severe injuries, Raven frees Touka from
            the metal chair she was tied to, and the two would quickly retreat back to Remnant, where they stayed for a
            little longer. Touka's home was rebuilt, and she would return home, glad to be back to how things used to
            be.
            However, upon waiting for Raven, Touka found that she did not return. No portals made, and she no longer
            appeared at the colosseum. This baffled Touka, but ultimately pushed her into a rather deep depression. Was
            she abandoned? Not again.. (Image WIP)

            Kaneki has grown to love fighting, and discovering this place was a godsend. The two began to catch up on

            Jason.
            To this, she was surprised, before giving a smile and thanking him, and the two would continue to bond in

            Due to her consuming massive amounts of flesh from Jason, she found herself slowly forming a kakuja over

            Whenever she got angry or extremely stressed, she would lose control, turning into a beetle-like Kakuja.
            Though over time she was helped by Kaneki to help out in containing it, and if it broke out, he would quell
            it. It wasn't until Mutsuki came back around and saught revenge against Touka for what happened at :re.
            After
            pushing her to near death, she finally lost herself to her kakuja, but this time, her deceased father,
            Arata,
            came from the dead to briefly invade her distorted mind and showed her the way to manifest the kakuja. When
            she regained consciousness, her kakuja was fully formed, coming to life with heightened strength and
            abilities, and she quickly dispatched Mutsuki and sent her packing. A few days later, Kaneki and Touka come
            together to go back to Tokyo, hunting down the traitorous Mutsuki and found her, only to realize that she
            had
            manifested a Kakuja of her own. Through effort and pain, the two slay Mutsuki, and with her death, and a
            final
            goodbye from Kaneki, they return home.
