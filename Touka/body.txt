 <h2 class="header">The Predator of Human-kind</h2>
 <div class="scroller">
 Ghouls are humanoids who survive by consuming human flesh. Unlike the mythical, undead versions that everyone has come to know, these ghouls are living, vulnerable to the clutches of hunger and death. They are biologically superior to humans, though they have staggering weaknesses. Ghouls' bodies are comprised of many RC cells, cells that normally humans possess, but Ghouls do in massive quantities. This abundance of RC cells cause them to be faster, stronger, and much more durable. They are effectively resistant to normal weaponry, even go as far as to say they are almost completely immune to them. Guns, blades, and other conventional weapons simply do not work on them, for they cannot cut the RC-filled skin. They have a special limb that is called a Kagune, which is a survival and hunting tool that comes out their body when they need to fight. Ghouls have different types of kagune, ranging from ranged types, regenerative, to tank-like, and even ones that which have no blaring weakness, or perhaps a mix breed of any. Ghouls can only be hurt by other ghouls, or by a weapons specifically made to deteriorate or break RC cells, such as a Ghoul Investigator's blades known as 'quinque'. A ghoul looks exactly like a human until they release their kagune, so they hide amongst the humans, pretending to be like them, and quietly taking lives to live on. If they were found out, their lives were over. They would be hunted and killed, every last ghoul. Such is the sick cycle of life and death.

 <h2 class="header">The Coffee Master Bluette</h2>
 <div class="scroller">
 Touka Kirishima is a ghoul, and one of the last survivors of the Kirishima bloodline. Through her passion for coffee, she strove to survive in the harsh world of Tokyo, eventually becoming a strong and loving person, despite her dark, tragic past. She owns a cafe in Japan known as ':re', and owns a cafe brand known as 'Kiri Cafe' that has spread its way into the Americas and still growing. Touka is an 'Ukaku' ghoul, which is a ghoul that excels in speed, landing in precise, lightning fast and deadly attacks, with a blaring weakness of low stamina. Ukaku are ranged, and not very effective up close, as they are usually very fragile, so they do their best to keep their distance.
 </div>
 </div>
 <div class="inmenu-tab" id="personality">
 <h2 class="header">Once Cruel, Now Loving</h2>
 <div class="scroller">
 Touka was once a very cruel person, disregarding humans in a rather hateful manner, often killing them merely from getting upset. However, she treated ghouls rather neutrally, unless known to be a pain. Over time, these feelings balanced out, and she became a more caring and loving individual in the face of both humans and ghouls alike. However, her cruel demeanor can occasionally manifest into some rough-housing time and again. Her love for coffee triumphs everything else, and she can always be seen holding a cup.
 </div>
 </div>
 <div class="inmenu-tab" id="gender">
 <h2 class="header">Sex of the Bluette</h2>
 <div class="scroller">
 Touka is female by default and is always female by roleplaying standards. With a separate roleplay unrelated to RPC canon, a plot item to change this, or a little bit of friendly shitposting, she could become a futa.
 </div>
 </div>
 <div class="inmenu-tab" id="sexual-orientation">
 <h2 class="header">What does she like?</h2>
 <div class="scroller">
 Touka is almost exclusively into other women, extra or not. She finds the feminine body much more appealing than the other sex. A walkup from a male seeking sexual actions is guaranteed to end up in failure.

 <h2 class="header">Little Touka</h2>
 <div class="scroller">
 <p>
 In the very beginning, Touka was as an innocent little ghoul squirt as they came. For the first five years of her life, her story was filled with the love and care that a small child should always be given. She was very happy, and a very nice child, even though she occasionally got jealous of her little brother, Ayato, when he got attention.

 <h2 class="header">The Kirishima Family</h2>
 <div class="scroller">
 <p>
 Touka was in the loving care of her father, Arata Kirishima. The mother was hardly around, leaving most of the care of the siblings in his hands. Her brother was Ayato Kirishima, also a kind child, though had very different opinions about the various things around them. Arata held a terrible secret from his kids; a secret they would not discover for a very, very long time. A secret that made him pay the price.

 <div class="scroller">
 <p>
 One day, the two siblings found an injured bird and moved to take care of it, nursing it back to health. One day it lashed out on Touka when it began to lash out in a frenzy, shooting from the cage and pecking her right above her eye, leaving a scar. It is the reason why she hides her other eye, is so people would not see the old injury. To this day, Touka has an phobia for bird-like creatures.

 <div class="scroller">
 <p>
 In what seemed like a peaceful ghoul life, one day they found that their father had not returned, and the locals had come to seek the children they somehow figured out were ghouls. The locals managed to harm Ayato, but Touka, using her kagune early (and damaged it in the process), defended her little brother from their onslaught and attempted captures. They were ran out of the place they once called home. With no signs of Father, they continued to move, unaware of their destination.. or of how long they could keep it up.

 <p>
 Yoshimura, an unknown old man, had found the Kirishima twins in a rough state. Merely only children, and clinging to life however they could. Yoshimura took in the two children, giving them a home in a cafe that he owned, called 'Anteiku'. It was there that the two ghouls would continue to live, and as they slowly grew up in new territory, they began to turn cold to the world around them, as the world had taken their happiness away despite Yoshimura's attempts to keep them docile and friendly folk.

 <div class="scroller">
 <p>
Despite Yoshimura's attempts to raise them to be loving people, Touka and Ayato had turned into ruthless ghouls who consistently encroached in other ghoul's feeding grounds, causing them to become very hated by the rest of the ward. They often got into fights with people over the smallest things, though Ayato was mostly the cause of these actions, with Touka merely following them.

 <p>
As the two siblings developed, their caretaker, Yoshimura, was pushing them to become more active in the human community. School was one such attempt, not only to mingle and understand humans better, but to also move up on life and perhaps one day get a job and home of their own through education. Touka was hesitant on the thought of school, even when Yoshimura offered to fully pay for her schooling. While Touka eventually caved in and decided to go, Ayato did not budge at all on the subject, claiming he absolutely loathed humans for what they did to Arata, his father.

 <p>
After a long while of attending school, Touka comes to enjoy the presence of humans. She makes friends at the school, especially with a specific young woman. Ayato sees the large change that the old man had pushed onto his sister, and absolutely loathed in. In a fit of anger, he lashed out at his sister, stating he could not believe she could become so cozy with the humans after what they have done to their family. Afterwards, he no longer saw a reason to stay at Anteiku. He left, leaving his sister behind and heading to the 24th ward and quickly became known as a problem there. Touka was left alone, and she fell into a deep depression for a very long time.

 <h2 class="header">Touka Meets a Book Nerd and his Friend</h2>
 <div class="scroller">
 <p>
 Lately she has found a young man that goes by Ken Kaneki visit the cafe more and more often and saw that this man was beginning to become a regular. He was quiet, and always had his nose in his book, so she didn't really mind him. He was quiet and kept to himself; a quality Touka was more than happy to see. On an evening after work she came across Kaneki walking with Rize, a ghoul that is known to be a binge eater; someone who eats humans indiscriminately. It was clear that Kaneki was the next meal for her. Touka gave a scowl and minded her own business, leaving Kaneki to his fate.

 <div class="scroller">
 <p>
 With the mysterious death of Rize, Touka saw a commotion about fighting for territory Rize once had. One of them was a person known as Nishiki, a high school student who is very territorial. The other was Kaneki, who was somehow still alive. Touka dispatched Nishiki with ease, being much stronger than him. He ran away, leaving Kaneki to the bluette. She soon discovered that he was not actually human, but some kind of half human, half ghoul hybrid. Kaneki began to speak about being once human, and Touka immediately began to berate him, calling him prey and trash, that he would not last long in this new cruel world. She began to viciously attack Kaneki with fists and feet in anger when being called a monster, only to be stopped by Yoshimura. He was taken in by the old man, much to Touka's open disappointment.

 Yoshimura detects trouble brewing once again with Nishiki, and sends Touka to stop the fighting. She takes off, eventually arriving at a very interesting scene; Nishiki was defeated by Kaneki. Despite being told to eat human meat to stave off starvation, Kaneki refused and eventually gave into the hunger and he made for his unconscious friend. At this point, Touka had made her way in and decided to do a solid for the man she didn't like, and got in the way of his feast. Kaneki, now pissed off and filled with a raging hunger, goes for Touka. Touka flourishes her kagune and easily defeats Kaneki. Kaneki wakes up later at the cafe she works at, Anteiku. He was talked to again by Yoshimura and was fed while unconscious, and then offered shelter and safety from other ghouls if he worked at Anteiku. Kaneki accepts and starts working there.

 The next day, Ryouko, and her daughter Himani, stop by because one of the strongest ghouls in the 20th ward, known as Jason, stopped by Asaki's (Himani's father) work and demanded a new torturing tool for his sick ideals. They came out of fear something might have happened to their beloved family member, and Touka was quick to calm them down. Touka is friends with the Ryouko and is always looking out for her. The two women move to talk to Yoshimura in private, leaving Kaneki and Touka to themselves for the time being. Touka could not help but wonder what the issue was, but kept it to herself for the time being.

 <h2 class="header">Touka Takes Kaneki to Get His Mask Made</h2>
 <div class="scroller">
 <p>
 Due to the activities from Rize and Jason, ghoul hunters (or the 'Doves') have become more active in the 20th ward. As a result, Yoshimura sends Touka to take Kaneki to get his mask made by a friend named Uta. When fighting, a ghoul must keep themselves anonymous, for only a face is needed to hunt down a ghoul. The doves could get an identity match on the ghoul and use it to find their name, and then where they live, what they do, and so on. So when out in the field ready to hunt or kill, it was important to have a mask, and that is the purpose of this visit. Touka minds herself as Kaneki and Uta talk about the mask, before eventually bringing up Touka's good looks and wondered why Kaneki didn't have a big interest in her. He replied that he did, but he 'was also scared of Touka'. Touka caught none of this conversation.

While initially she despised Kaneki for being a half-breed and the way she was talked to back in the alley on their second meet, she slowly becomes more and more used to Kaneki's presence, even to the point where she was surprised he was helping her learn words from complicated books. Hidden from sight, she was happy to hear that Hinami was being taken care of quite well.

Another day passes and a new character, known as Shuu, or the 'Gourmet' comes in to assess the situation at Anteiku. He finds Kaneki and immediately becomes interested in him. Though he was not able to indulge long with the half-breed. Touka was quick to shoo him away. She was aware that Shuu enjoyed snatching people and then feeding them to ghouls in some kind of restaurant, and she immediately would have none of that. After Shuu's departure, the woman informed Kaneki not to go near that man, as he was nothing but trouble. However, with the lure of Shu being a bookworm, Kaneki ended up ignoring her warning.

Touka quickly learns of Shuu kidnapping Nishiki's girlfriend to lure Kaneki into a trap. The reason? Shuu wanted to eat Kaneki, as he was a half-breed and they were so rare that they were unheard of, and apparently quite tasty. Nishiki, still injured with his fight from Kaneki, regrettably teams up with Kaneki and they both set off to rescue the damsel in distress. However, when the two went into the 
church for the rescue, they were easily defeated by Shuu. It was then that Touka arrived with a sneak attack on Shuu. He recovers, and the two would battle it out, with the bluette fighting to save her co-worker. After a hard-fought battle, Touka came out on top, spitting on his corpse and telling him to eat his own flesh if he wanted to live. </p>

The fight against Shuu took a massive toll on Touka's body, and she required a few days to rest, unable to work. When she recovered, she found that the Anteiku staff have gathered in a meeting, and with confusion, she pushed herself in to find out what was going on. She found out that Ryouko, as well as her husband, were both slain by the Doves. Ryouko and her husband were peaceful ghouls, unable to hunt and kill humans, and got their meals from Anteiku. Touka was angry; why take the lives of innocent people? Simply because they were ghouls, that was the only reason they were slain. With thoughts of her friend dead, and the kid they left behind now an orphan, the woman's heart fills with unbridled rage. Vengeance was on her mind. Yoshimura downtalks Touka, telling her not to go out to get revenge, as doing so would bring more attention to the 20th ward. Touka ignores this warning and runs straight out of Anteiku to get revenge.

Touka finds a small mask that she used to use when she played with Ayato; a bunny mask. She dons it, as well as a getup she threw together, then went out to fight the doves responsible for Ryouko's death. She managed to kill one of them, but before she could kill the others, the one who struck down Ryouko appeared; Kureo Mado. She attacked at him and Mado quickly figured out she was there to avenge Ryouko and began to belittle Touka, insulting her to become more angry. Despite her efforts, she could barely even lay a hand on her opponent, and with an easy strike to Touka, she was forced to flee, that one attack greatly injuring the woman. She went back to Anteiku and the staff there scolded her, telling her she would receive no help from her injuries. She gave a grunt and attended to attempt first aid on herself with no success. Kaneki attempts to help, but drives him away. He assured Touka to be careful because if she were to die, he would be sad. This greatly confused her, catching her off guard. The words sank into her head as she fumbled with the bandages in the first aid kit. The fight against Mado officially gave her the nickname, 'The Rabbit'. A name which all ghoul investigators come to know.

 <div class="scroller">
 <p>
Touka, still recovering from her injury, was attempting to set up a trap for Mado to avenge Ryouko. She set up false information to a location to lure him in, but Mado was one step ahead, taking Ryouko's remains and stashing them into said location ahead of time. The scent of her mother lures Himani and she rushes off in excitement, causing Touka to panic and attempt to stop her with no success. Upon arriving, Mado was quick to ambush Touka and Hinami. Since Touka was unable to bide time to grab her mask and outfit, she was fully exposed to the ghoul investigator. This officially became a kill-or-be-killed scenario, for if they escaped, they would simply track her to Anteiku, and the shop would suffer, so one of them had to die. The fight began, and Touka, still injured, was quickly overpowered by Mado's quinque, which was so happened to be made by Ryouko's kagune, angering Touka even further. However at this point, Touka was all talk. She was on deaths door with several holes in her. When Mado began to deliver the final blow, the little Hinami that was sobbing the whole time finally acted out in pure rage. Hinami quickly slays Mado with impressive power, but refused to finish him off. The injured Touka brought herself up and finished off the investigator and Touka takes Hinami home, surprised that Hinami already had her kagune.

 Jason, who is looking for Rize and unaware of her death, comes to the 20th ward in an attempt to find her. They end up arriving at Anteiku, which they find that, apparently, Kaneki hosts Rize's organs. They smell this on him and decide to kidnap Kaneki. As usual, Touka moves to defend Kaneki from Jason, but an unexpected visitor appeared; Ayato. Her brother whom left her to reign freely over humans. He gets in her way and the two begin to fight. However, Ayato easily defeats Touka. Due to their blood relation, he decides to spare Touka, telling her to crawl along the ground like the worm she was. The group then leaves with Kaneki, leaving an unconcious bluette ghoul in the destroyed Anteiku.

The CCG (Coalition of Counter Ghouls. Or 'doves') have located Jason's whereabouts, and discover he is working for a ghoul organization that was known as "Aogiri". Aogiri is a group of powerful ghouls that lead an army with the intent on destroying human kind and make the world ghoul superior. The CCG move in with an army to assault the hidden base, and the members of Anteiku slip in through the chaos to try and find Kaneki. The group splits up, and while Touka searches, she ends up finding her brother once again, stopping her in her tracks. She attempts to disengage from him with no success, and the two battle it out. Once again, she was utterly defeated by her stronger brother, Ayato. This time, it looked like Ayato was moving for a killing blow.

 Kaneki manages to break himself out of the hellish prison that Jason had put up for him, killing Jason in the process.  On his way out, he finds Touka beaten and worn by her brother and quickly intervenes to prevent her from being finished off.  She is taken to safety and proceeds to beat Ayato half to death, breaking exactly half of the bones in the male's body, silencing his screams with the phrase 'Does it hurt?  Though Touka went through more pain than this.'  Kaneki left Ayato alive due to him being the only family Touka had left.  Afterwards he told Touka that he will be not returning to Anteiku, apologized, and left a fumbling woman alone, the gal falling soon into depression once again, having lost yet another friend.

She blurted out hateful words to him about being selfish and never putting his friends first, and that she hated him for it.  He then replied that as long as she was safe, then he was fine with that.  This tilted her over the edge, and she socked Kaneki right in the face and told him never to come back.

She was stopped again by Yomo, and this time he did not budge, telling her to forget about him and focus on her future.  She was too young to die now; what about college?  Her future?

There are times where life seems not worth living.  But you have to remember that there are people who shed blood and tears for you, so that you could live on.

Shoulder your grief and push forward into the future, one which your loved ones would have wanted you to do.  Don't let their sacrifices be in vein.  With this in mind, Touka did just that.  With the threat of the CCG no longer looming over her, and with the help of Yomo, Touka opens a brand new cafe of her own to carry on the legacy of Yoshimura.  With a smile and a brush of her hair, she flipped the sign from 'closed' to 'open', and she made her way inside of her cafe, the bell ringing as the door opened.  The cafe's name?  .. <b>:re </b>.

She looks on at him, saddened by his fate.  However, it didn't matter.  It doesn't matter if he's changed appearance, it doesn't even matter if she's forgotten.

Eating human food is disgusting and dangerous for a ghoul, but for the child, it was necessary.  With great hesitation, she builds up the courage to eat, putting her health at risk for her baby.

 <div class="scroller">
 <p>
 Due to Nishiki spying on Touka as she ate, Kaneki soon learns that indeed Touka was pregnant.  He rushed to the place she was staying at and tried to subtly as how she was feeling, though he was being rather terrible at it, upsetting her.  It was after she calmed down that she informed him that she's pregnant.  The male stared, before letting her know that he was very happy to hear that, a reply which shocked Touka.  "R-really?" she spoke, causing him to nod, and she became happy with his approval.
